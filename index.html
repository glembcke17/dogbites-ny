			They say a dog is a man’s best friend and that continues to ring true to this day. Not only do they help improve one’s mental health, but they also improve social connection and physical activity. While pets help their owner’s lives, it is also important to care for them and neutering is one of the ways to do so.

				Dog bites have become a rising problem in the state of New York, with 7,163 attacks having happened since 2018. From children to teens and even the elderly, this issue has affected people of all ages and backgrounds. According to a dataset provided by the state, out of these instances, 75.13% of dogs were not neutered, while 25% had received this procedure. Most of these attacks occurred around Central Park, where more than 1.5 million dogs are walked each year, according to Central Park Conservancy.

			Neutering dogs can have many benefits according to Mayo Clinic, such as preventing testicular cancer, uterus infections, and aggressive behaviors. In fact, according to Tumwater Veterinary Hospital, neutered dogs can live one and a half years longer than those that are not.

				“It is important to spay and neuter your pets, not only for their protection, but also for the benefit of the community,” said Steven Austad, professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Many dogs who struggle with disorders associated with intact dogs end up being put to death.”
